    "text =  \"\"\"  All my friends. Settle down let me talk, I will get more and more emotional (crowd gets louder as he composes himself). My life, between 22 yards for 24 years, it is hard to believe that that wonderful journey has come to an end, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank people who have played an important role in my life. Also, for the first time in my life I am carrying this list, to remember all the names in case I forget someone. I hope you understand. It's getting a little bit difficult to talk but I will manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important person in my life, and I have missed him a lot since 1999 when he passed away, my father. Without his guidance, I don't think I would have been standing here in front of you. He gave me freedom at the age of 11, and told me that [I should] chase my dreams, but make sure you do not find shortcuts. The path might be difficult but don't give up, and I have simply followed his instructions. Above all, he told me to be a nice human being, which I will continue to do and try my best. Every time I have done something special [and] showed my bat, it was [for] my father.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My mother, I don't know how she dealt with such a naughty child like me. I was not easy to manage. She must be extremely patient. For a mother, the most important thing is that her child remains safe and healthy and fit. That was what she was most bothered and worried about. She took care of me for the last 24 years that I have played for India, but even before that she started praying for me the day I started playing cricket. She just prayed and prayed and I think her prayers and blessings have given me the strength to go out and perform, so a big thank you to my mother for all the sacrifices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In my school days, for four years, I stayed with my uncle and aunt because my school was quite far from my home, and they treated me like their son. My aunt, after having had a hard day's play, I would be half asleep and she would be feeding me food so I could go again and play tomorrow. I can't forget these moments. I am like their son and I am glad it has continued to be the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My eldest brother, Nitin, and his family, have always encouraged me. My eldest brother doesn't like to talk much, but the one thing he always told me is that whatever you do, I know you will always give it 100%, and that I have full faith and confidence in you. His encouragement meant a lot to me. My sister, Savita, and her family, was no different. The first cricket bat of my life was presented to me by my sister. It was a Kashmir willow bat. But that is where the journey began. She is one of those many who still continue to fast when I bat, so thank you very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ajit, my brother, now what do I talk about him? I don't know. We have lived this dream together. He was the one who sacrificed his career for my cricket. He spotted the spark in me. And it all started from the age of 11 when he took me to Archrekar sir, my coach, and from there on my life changed. You will find this hard to believe but even last night he called to discuss my dismissal, knowing that there was a remote chance of batting again, but just the habit we have developed, the rapport we have developed, since my birth, has continued and it will continue. Maybe when I'm not playing cricket we will still be discussing technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Various things we agreed upon, my technique, and so many technical things which I didn't agree with him, we have had arguments and disagreements, but when I look back at all these things in my life, I would have been a lesser cricketer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most beautiful thing happened to me in 1990 when I met my wife, Anjali. Those were special years and it has continued and will always continue that way. I know Anjali, being a doctor; there was a wonderful career in front of her. When we decided to have a family, Anjali took the initiative to step back and say that 'you continue with your cricket and I will take the responsibility of the family'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Without that, I don't think I would have been able to play cricket freely and without stress. Thanks for bearing with all my fuss and all my frustrations, and all sorts of rubbish that I have spoken. Thanks for bearing with me and always staying by my side through all the ups and downs. You are the best partnership I've had in my life.\n",
    "Then, the two precious diamonds of my life, Sara and Arjun. They have already grown up. My daughter is 16, my son is 14. Time has flown by. I wanted to spend so much time with them on special occasions like their birthdays, their annual days, their sports day, going on holidays, whatever. I have missed out on all those things. Thanks for your understanding. Both of you have been so, so special to me you cannot imagine. I promise you [that] for 14 and 16 years I have not spent enough time with both of you, but the next 16 years or even beyond that, everything is for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My in-laws, Anand Mehta and Annabel, both have been so, so supportive [and] loving and caring. I have discussed on various things in life, generally with them, and have taken their advice. You know, it's so important to have a strong family who is always with you and who are guiding you. Before you start clapping, the most important thing they did was allowing me to marry Anjali, so thank you very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last 24 years that I have played for India I have made new friends, and before that I have had friends from my childhood. They have all had a terrific contribution. As and when I have called them to come and bowl to me at the nets, they have left their work aside to come and help me. Be it joining me on holidays and having discussions with me on cricket, or how I was a little stressed and wanting to find a solution so I can perform better.\n",
    "All those moments my friends were with me. Even for when I was injured, I would wake up in the morning because I couldn't sleep and thought that my career was over because of injuries, that is when my friends have woken up at 3 o'clock in the morning to drive with me and make me believe that my career was not over. Life would be incomplete without all those friends. Thanks for being there for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My cricket career started when I was 11. The turning point of my career was when my brother (Ajit) took me to Achrekar sir. I was extremely delighted to see him up in the stands. Normally he sits in front of the television and he watches all the games that I play. When I was 11/12, those were the days when I used to hop back on his scooter and play a couple of practice matches a day. The first half the innings I would be batting at Shivaji Park, the second half, at some other match in Azad Maidan. He would take me all over Mumbai to make sure I got match practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On a lighter note, in the last 29 years, sir has never ever said 'well played' to me because he thought I would get complacent and I would stop working hard. Maybe he can push his luck and wish me now, well done on my career, because there are no more matches, sir, in my life. I will be witnessing cricket, and cricket will always stay in my heart, but you have had an immense contribution in my life, so thank you very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My cricket for Mumbai started right here on this ground, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), which is so dear to me. I remember landing from New Zealand at four o'clock in the morning, and turning up for a game here at eight o'clock just because I wanted to be a part of Mumbai cricket, and not that somebody forced me. That was for the love of Mumbai cricket, and thank you very much. The president is here so thank you very much, along with your team, for taking care of me and looking after my cricket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dream was obviously to play for India, and that is where my association with BCCI started. BCCI was fantastic, right from my debut they believed in my ability and selecting me into the squad at the age of 16 was a big step, so thanks to all the selectors for having faith in me and the BCCI for giving me the freedom to express myself out in the middle. Things would have been different if you had not been behind me, and I really appreciate your support. Especially when I was injured, you were right with me and making sure that all the treatments were taken care of, and that I got fit and fine and playing [right] back for India.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey has been special, the last 24 years, I have played with many senior cricketers, and even before that there were many senior cricketers with whom I watched on television. They inspired me to play cricket, and to play in the right way. Thanks to all those senior cricketers, and unfortunately I have not been able to play with them, but I have high regards for all their achievements and all their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We see it on the mega-screen, Rahul, Laxman, Sourav, and Anil, who is not here, and my team-mates right here in front me. You are like my family away from home. I have had some wonderful times with you. It is going to be difficult to not be part of the dressing room, sharing those special moments. All the coaches for their guidance, it has been special for me. I know when MS Dhoni presented me the 200th Test match cap on Day One morning. I had a brief message for the team. I would like to repeat that. I just feel that all of us are so, so fortunate and proud to be part of the Indian cricket team and serving the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing all of you guys, I know you will continue to serve the nation in the right spirit and right values. I believe we have been the lucky ones to be chosen by the Almighty to serve this sport. Each generation gets this opportunity to take care of this sport and serve it to the best of our ability. I have full faith in you to continue to serve the nation in the right spirit and to the best of your ability, to bring all the laurels to the country. All the very best.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would be failing in my duties if I did not thank all the doctors, the physios, the trainers, who have put this difficult body together to go back on the field and be able to play. The amount of injuries that I have had in my career, I don't know how you have managed to keep me fit, but without your special efforts, it would never have happened. The doctors have met me at weird hours. I mean I have called them from Mumbai to Chennai, Mumbai to Delhi, I mean wherever. They have just taken the next flight and left their work and families to be with me, which has allowed me to play. So a big thank you to all three of you for keeping me in good shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My dear friend, late Mark Mascarenhas, my first manager. We unfortunately lost him in a car accident in 2001, but he was such a well-wisher of cricket, my cricket, and especially Indian cricket. He was so passionate. He understood what it takes to represent a nation and gave me all the space to go out and express myself, and never pressurised me to do this ad or promotion or whatever the sponsors demanded. He took care of that and today I miss him, so thank you Mark for all your contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "My current management team, WSG, for repeating what Mark has done, because when I signed the contract I exactly told them what I want from them, and what it requires to represent me. They have done that and respected that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone who has worked closely with me for 14 years is my manager, Vinod Nayudu. He is more like my family and all the sacrifices, spending time away from his family for my work, has been special, so big thank you to his family as well for giving up so much time for my work with Vinod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In my school days, when I performed well, the media backed me a lot. They continue to do that till this morning. Thank you so much to the media for supporting and appreciating my performances. It surely had a positive effect on me. Thank you so much to all the photographers as well for those wonderfully captured moments that will stay with me for the rest of my life, so a big thank you to all the photographers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I know my speech is getting a bit too long (crowd roars with 'noooo'), but this is the last thing I want to say. I want to thank all the people here who have flown in from various parts of the world, and have supported me endlessly, whether I scored a 0 or a 100-plus. Your support was so dear to me and meant a lot to me. Whatever you have done for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I know I have met so many guys who have fasted for me, prayed for me, done so much for me. Without that life wouldn't have been like this for me. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and also say that time has flown by rather quickly, but the memories you have left with me will always be with me forever and ever, especially \"Sachin, Sachin\" which will reverberate in my ears till I stop breathing. Thank you very much. If I have missed out on saying something, I hope you understand. Goodbye.\n",

       "'  all my friends  settle down let me talk  i will get more and more emotional  crowd gets louder as he composes himself   my life  between    yards for    years  it is hard to believe that that wonderful journey has come to an end  but i would like to take this opportunity to thank people who have played an important role in my life  also  for the first time in my life i am carrying this list  to remember all the names in case i forget someone  i hope you understand  it s getting a little bit difficult to talk but i will manage    the most important person in my life  and i have missed him a lot since      when he passed away  my father  without his guidance  i don t think i would have been standing here in front of you  he gave me freedom at the age of     and told me that  i should  chase my dreams  but make sure you do not find shortcuts  the path might be difficult but don t give up  and i have simply followed his instructions  above all  he told me to be a nice human being  which i will continue to do and try my best  every time i have done something special  and  showed my bat  it was  for  my father    my mother  i don t know how she dealt with such a naughty child like me  i was not easy to manage  she must be extremely patient  for a mother  the most important thing is that her child remains safe and healthy and fit  that was what she was most bothered and worried about  she took care of me for the last    years that i have played for india  but even before that she started praying for me the day i started playing cricket  she just prayed and prayed and i think her prayers and blessings have given me the strength to go out and perform  so a big thank you to my mother for all the sacrifices    in my school days  for four years  i stayed with my uncle and aunt because my school was quite far from my home  and they treated me like their son  my aunt  after having had a hard day s play  i would be half asleep and she would be feeding me food so i could go again and play tomorrow  i can t forget these moments  i am like their son and i am glad it has continued to be the same way    my eldest brother  nitin  and his family  have always encouraged me  my eldest brother doesn t like to talk much  but the one thing he always told me is that whatever you do  i know you will always give it       and that i have full faith and confidence in you  his encouragement meant a lot to me  my sister  savita  and her family  was no different  the first cricket bat of my life was presented to me by my sister  it was a kashmir willow bat  but that is where the journey began  she is one of those many who still continue to fast when i bat  so thank you very much    ajit  my brother  now what do i talk about him  i don t know  we have lived this dream together  he was the one who sacrificed his career for my cricket  he spotted the spark in me  and it all started from the age of    when he took me to archrekar sir  my coach  and from there on my life changed  you will find this hard to believe but even last night he called to discuss my dismissal  knowing that there was a remote chance of batting again  but just the habit we have developed  the rapport we have developed  since my birth  has continued and it will continue  maybe when i m not playing cricket we will still be discussing technique    various things we agreed upon  my technique  and so many technical things which i didn t agree with him  we have had arguments and disagreements  but when i look back at all these things in my life  i would have been a lesser cricketer    the most beautiful thing happened to me in      when i met my wife  anjali  those were special years and it has continued and will always continue that way  i know anjali  being a doctor  there was a wonderful career in front of her  when we decided to have a family  anjali took the initiative to step back and say that  you continue with your cricket and i will take the responsibility of the family     without that  i don t think i would have been able to play cricket freely and without stress  thanks for bearing with all my fuss and all my frustrations  and all sorts of rubbish that i have spoken  thanks for bearing with me and always staying by my side through all the ups and downs  you are the best partnership i ve had in my life  then  the two precious diamonds of my life  sara and arjun  they have already grown up  my daughter is     my son is     time has flown by  i wanted to spend so much time with them on special occasions like their birthdays  their annual days  their sports day  going on holidays  whatever  i have missed out on all those things  thanks for your understanding  both of you have been so  so special to me you cannot imagine  i promise you  that  for    and    years i have not spent enough time with both of you  but the next    years or even beyond that  everything is for you    my in laws  anand mehta and annabel  both have been so  so supportive  and  loving and caring  i have discussed on various things in life  generally with them  and have taken their advice  you know  it s so important to have a strong family who is always with you and who are guiding you  before you start clapping  the most important thing they did was allowing me to marry anjali  so thank you very much   in the last    years that i have played for india i have made new friends  and before that i have had friends from my childhood  they have all had a terrific contribution  as and when i have called them to come and bowl to me at the nets  they have left their work aside to come and help me  be it joining me on holidays and having discussions with me on cricket  or how i was a little stressed and wanting to find a solution so i can perform better  all those moments my friends were with me  even for when i was injured  i would wake up in the morning because i couldn t sleep and thought that my career was over because of injuries  that is when my friends have woken up at   o clock in the morning to drive with me and make me believe that my career was not over  life would be incomplete without all those friends  thanks for being there for me    my cricket career started when i was     the turning point of my career was when my brother  ajit  took me to achrekar sir  i was extremely delighted to see him up in the stands  normally he sits in front of the television and he watches all the games that i play  when i was        those were the days when i used to hop back on his scooter and play a couple of practice matches a day  the first half the innings i would be batting at shivaji park  the second half  at some other match in azad maidan  he would take me all over mumbai to make sure i got match practice    on a lighter note  in the last    years  sir has never ever said  well played  to me because he thought i would get complacent and i would stop working hard  maybe he can push his luck and wish me now  well done on my career  because there are no more matches  sir  in my life  i will be witnessing cricket  and cricket will always stay in my heart  but you have had an immense contribution in my life  so thank you very much    my cricket for mumbai started right here on this ground  the mumbai cricket association  mca   which is so dear to me  i remember landing from new zealand at four o clock in the morning  and turning up for a game here at eight o clock just because i wanted to be a part of mumbai cricket  and not that somebody forced me  that was for the love of mumbai cricket  and thank you very much  the president is here so thank you very much  along with your team  for taking care of me and looking after my cricket    the dream was obviously to play for india  and that is where my association with bcci started  bcci was fantastic  right from my debut they believed in my ability and selecting me into the squad at the age of    was a big step  so thanks to all the selectors for having faith in me and the bcci for giving me the freedom to express myself out in the middle  things would have been different if you had not been behind me  and i really appreciate your support  especially when i was injured  you were right with me and making sure that all the treatments were taken care of  and that i got fit and fine and playing  right  back for india    the journey has been special  the last    years  i have played with many senior cricketers  and even before that there were many senior cricketers with whom i watched on television  they inspired me to play cricket  and to play in the right way  thanks to all those senior cricketers  and unfortunately i have not been able to play with them  but i have high regards for all their achievements and all their contributions    we see it on the mega screen  rahul  laxman  sourav  and anil  who is not here  and my team mates right here in front me  you are like my family away from home  i have had some wonderful times with you  it is going to be difficult to not be part of the dressing room  sharing those special moments  all the coaches for their guidance  it has been special for me  i know when ms dhoni presented me the    th test match cap on day one morning  i had a brief message for the team  i would like to repeat that  i just feel that all of us are so  so fortunate and proud to be part of the indian cricket team and serving the nation    knowing all of you guys  i know you will continue to serve the nation in the right spirit and right values  i believe we have been the lucky ones to be chosen by the almighty to serve this sport  each generation gets this opportunity to take care of this sport and serve it to the best of our ability  i have full faith in you to continue to serve the nation in the right spirit and to the best of your ability  to bring all the laurels to the country  all the very best    i would be failing in my duties if i did not thank all the doctors  the physios  the trainers  who have put this difficult body together to go back on the field and be able to play  the amount of injuries that i have had in my career  i don t know how you have managed to keep me fit  but without your special efforts  it would never have happened  the doctors have met me at weird hours  i mean i have called them from mumbai to chennai  mumbai to delhi  i mean wherever  they have just taken the next flight and left their work and families to be with me  which has allowed me to play  so a big thank you to all three of you for keeping me in good shape    my dear friend  late mark mascarenhas  my first manager  we unfortunately lost him in a car accident in       but he was such a well wisher of cricket  my cricket  and especially indian cricket  he was so passionate  he understood what it takes to represent a nation and gave me all the space to go out and express myself  and never pressurised me to do this ad or promotion or whatever the sponsors demanded  he took care of that and today i miss him  so thank you mark for all your contribution   my current management team  wsg  for repeating what mark has done  because when i signed the contract i exactly told them what i want from them  and what it requires to represent me  they have done that and respected that    someone who has worked closely with me for    years is my manager  vinod nayudu  he is more like my family and all the sacrifices  spending time away from his family for my work  has been special  so big thank you to his family as well for giving up so much time for my work with vinod    in my school days  when i performed well  the media backed me a lot  they continue to do that till this morning  thank you so much to the media for supporting and appreciating my performances  it surely had a positive effect on me  thank you so much to all the photographers as well for those wonderfully captured moments that will stay with me for the rest of my life  so a big thank you to all the photographers    i know my speech is getting a bit too long  crowd roars with  noooo    but this is the last thing i want to say  i want to thank all the people here who have flown in from various parts of the world  and have supported me endlessly  whether i scored a   or a     plus  your support was so dear to me and meant a lot to me  whatever you have done for me    i know i have met so many guys who have fasted for me  prayed for me  done so much for me  without that life wouldn t have been like this for me  i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart  and also say that time has flown by rather quickly  but the memories you have left with me will always be with me forever and ever  especially  sachin  sachin  which will reverberate in my ears till i stop breathing  thank you very much  if i
